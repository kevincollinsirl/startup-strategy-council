The key insight is that your current position - strong SMB product-market fit, 18-month runway, and growing enterprise interest - favors strategic optionality over full commitment. The hybrid approach allows you to validate enterprise demand with 2-3 pilot customers while maintaining SMB growth momentum. Critical success factors: (1) dedicate no more than 30% of engineering time to enterprise features, (2) only pursue enterprise deals that align with existing product capabilities, (3) set clear milestone gates for evaluating enterprise expansion. The main risk is resource dilution, which can be mitigated through strict prioritization frameworks.",
